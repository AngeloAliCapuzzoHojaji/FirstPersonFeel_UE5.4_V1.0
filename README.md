Hello to anyone (if at all) to this Unreal Engine 5.4 project!

This serves as a hub for all my fps mechanics, visuals, sfx, and other stuff you would find in a fps.
Feel free to use it however you like.

So far I will list what I have implemented, as well as sources if applicable:

-Procedural Animations, viemodel sway, dipping, rotation, and camera shake
-Sprinting, crouching, sliding, aim down sights, and double jumping
-Weapon rifle (very wip) with basic functinality like reloading and firing with currently no mag
-Widget based center reticle that inherits some procedural movement albiet very minor movement

All copied from OCTAHEDRON's playlist:

Copied from Jack French's video about the material but also referenced in OCTAHEDRON's Part 5 Video
-Depth pass for viewmodel so it never clips into world geometry

That is it for now! I will be updating these here and there! Maybe hope for some multiplayer in the future *wink* *wink* *cries*
