# Unreal Engine 5.4 FPS Project

Welcome to this Unreal Engine 5.4 project!

This repository serves as a hub for all my FPS mechanics, visuals, sound effects (SFX), and other features you would typically find in a first-person shooter. Feel free to use it however you like!

## Features Implemented So Far

### Procedural Animations
- Viewmodel sway, dipping, rotation, and camera shake.

### Movement Mechanics

- Crouching.
- Sliding.
- Aim Down Sights (ADS).
- Double jumping.

### Weapon Mechanics
- A basic rifle (work in progress) with:
  - Basic firing functionality.
  - Reloading functionality.
  - No magazine implementation yet.

### UI Features
- Widget-based center reticle with minor procedural movement.

### Depth Pass
- Prevents the viewmodel from clipping into world geometry.

### OCTAHEDRON's Playlist
- Many features, including procedural animations and movement mechanics, were adapted from OCTAHEDRON's tutorials with minor modifications.

### Jack French's Material Tutorial
- Depth pass implementation for the viewmodel was based on Jack French's video.

## Future Plans
- Continued updates to existing features.
- Potential multiplayer functionality (*wink* *wink* *cries*).

Stay tuned for more updates!


That is it for now! I will be updating these here and there! Maybe hope for some multiplayer in the future *wink* *wink* *cries*
